## Overview

> Thanks to Prof. Nina Amenta for sponsoring and giving out valuable advice to this course. Also, thanks to Prof. Sam King for encouraging me to make this course happen.

This course will teach you how to develop iOS apps with SwiftUI and other new technologies offered in the latest iOS. We will focus on UI construction, animation, navigation, and wonderful Swift language features! Due to the limitation of the course unit, we will not overload you with full topics on iOS development. If you're interested, more optional materials (pre-recorded videos or readings) might be provided to prepare you more for iOS development.

## Do I need ECS 150 (OS) and ECS 140 (Programming Language)?

This course will be different from the ECS 189E offered by [Prof. Sam King](https://bob.cs.ucdavis.edu/), where OS is highly involved. This course will mainly focus on constructing the UI and animation with SwiftUI and some advanced language features in Swift. Hence, we will not heavily rely on ECS 150 here.  However, the knowledge of OS will definitely help you understand course materials. Also, optional materials on advanced scheduling might be provided for your interests. Since you will learn Swift, a functional programming language, ECS 140 will definitely help you quickly pick up Swift in this course.
