## Overview

> Thanks to Prof. Nina Amenta for sponsoring and giving out valuable advice to this course. Also, thanks to Prof. Sam King for encouraging me to make this course happen.

This course will teach you how to develop iOS apps with SwiftUI and other new technologies offered in the latest iOS. We will focus on UI construction, animation, navigation, and wonderful Swift language features! Due to the limitation of the course unit, we will not overload you with full topics on iOS development. If you're interested, more optional materials (pre-recorded videos or readings) might be provided to prepare you more for iOS development.

## Do I need ECS 150 (OS) and ECS 140 (Programming Language)?

This course will be different from the ECS 189E offered by [Prof. Sam King](https://bob.cs.ucdavis.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where OS is highly involved. This course will mainly focus on constructing the UI and animation with SwiftUI and some advanced language features in Swift. Hence, we will not heavily rely on ECS 150 here.  However, the knowledge of OS will definitely help you understand course materials. Also, optional materials on advanced scheduling might be provided for your interests. Since you will learn Swift, a functional programming language, ECS 140 will definitely help you quickly pick up Swift in this course.

## Late Submission Policy

> The late submission policy only applies to weekly assignments. No late submission will be granted for the group final project. Please start your final project as soon as possible.

Normally, each assignment will be released on Thursday and due on next Thursday 11:59 pm. You will have one week for each assignment.

Late submission will be granted upon request. If you wish to use extension, please email  [instructor](mailto:ybyan@ucdavis.edu) *before the original deadline* with title `[ECS 198F 003] Assignment{NUMBER} Extension Request` (replace the {NUMBER} with actual assignment number), just in case the email get filtered out. Please also include your roaster name and SID, so we can log the information correctly.

If no request is submitted before the original deadline, we will assume you don't need an extension.
{:.note title="Attention"}

We will grant **at most 4 days**, so the last day to submit is Monday 11:59 pm (assume the original deadline is Thursday 11:59 pm). For late submission penalty, please see below.

### Late Submission Penalty

The late submission penalty is calculated per assignment.

| Late Days  | Grade Penalty |
|   :---:    |     :---:     |
|  <= 1 Day  | 5%  |
| 1 ~ 2 Days | 10% |
| 2 ~ 3 Days | 15% |
| 3 ~ 4 Days | 20% |

If the extension is not requested, we will look at the last commit before the original deadline. If the extension is granted, we will look at the last commit before the extended the deadline and calculate the penalty based on that timestamp.
