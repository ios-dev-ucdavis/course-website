## Overview

> Thanks to Prof. Nina Amenta for sponsoring and giving out valuable advice to this course. Also, thanks to Prof. Sam King for encouraging me to make this course happen.

This course will teach you how to develop iOS apps with SwiftUI and other new technologies offered in the latest iOS. We will focus on UI construction, animation, navigation, and wonderful Swift language features! Due to the limitation of the course unit, we will not overload you with full topics on iOS development. If you're interested, more optional materials (pre-recorded videos or readings) might be provided to prepare you more for iOS development.

## Email Correspondence

For any general question regarding syllabus, logistics, or assignment, please post it on Discord or GitHub Discussion.

For personal or sensitive matter, you can directly send emails to [Yibo Yan](mailto:yifhuang@ucdavis.edu).

For any code-related question that you didn't get response promptly on discussion board, you can send emails to Yibo Yan and 'cc all tutors, so you can get your response as quick as possible.

Please DO NOT directly email to Prof. Amenta regarding this course unless if it is really necessary. Prof. Amenta doesn't directly lead this course. Therefore, she might not be able to help you.

## Tutor Sessions and Office Hours

All tutor sessions and office hours will be hold online via Zoom. If the current timing of tutor sessions and office hours don't work you, feel free to send the email to the student instructor and tutors.

Joining information can be found on Canvas's `Zoom` tab.

Upon request, we can set up more tutor sessions and OHs if you need more!

The student instructor and tutors will be active on Discord. Therefore, we are more than happy to provide text help or just jump into voice channel to help!

## Do I need ECS 150 (OS) and ECS 140 (Programming Language)?

This course will be different from the ECS 189E offered by [Prof. Sam King](https://bob.cs.ucdavis.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where OS is highly involved. This course will mainly focus on constructing the UI and animation with SwiftUI and some advanced language features in Swift. Hence, we will not heavily rely on ECS 150 here.  However, the knowledge of OS will definitely help you understand course materials. Also, optional materials on advanced scheduling might be provided for your interests. Since you will learn Swift, a functional programming language, ECS 140 will definitely help you quickly pick up Swift in this course.
